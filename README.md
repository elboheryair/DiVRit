# DiVRit

DiVRit, a Diacritizer with Visual Representation for Hebrew (IVRIT) text, is a novel Hebrew diacritization system that treats the task as a zero-shot classification problem. It uses a PIXEL-based Vision Language Model (VLM) to process diacritized word candidates as images, capturing the structural logic of Hebrew morphology natively.

This repository is the official implementation of our paper - [Hebrew Diacritics Restoration using Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26521).
